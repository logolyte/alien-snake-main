# alien-snake
A half-finished game made in C# with the Unity Engine for the game jam Ludum Dare 45. 
You control the alien snake with the arrow keys, and try to eat as many apples as possible before the time runs out. Pause the game with escape. Your greatest enemies are the borders of the world and the incredible speeds you reach after eating about 200 apples. The purple snake enemy is petrified and works more like a hockey puck than an actual enemy. 
My computer unfortunately crashed because I ran out of hard drive space during the game jam, and that was the only thing preventing this game from becoming a true masterpiece.
